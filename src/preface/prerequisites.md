# Prerequisites

Building an LFS system is not a simple task. It requires a certainlevel of existing knowledge of Unix system administration in order to resolveproblems and correctly execute the commands listed. In particular, as anabsolute minimum, you should already have the ability to use thecommand line (shell) to copy or move files and directories, list directoryand file contents, and change the current directory. It is also expected thatyou have a reasonable knowledge of using and installing Linuxsoftware.

Because the LFS book assumes *at least* this basiclevel of skill, the various LFS support forums are unlikely to be able toprovide you with much assistance in these areas. You will find that yourquestions regarding such basic knowledge will likely go unanswered or youwill simply be referred to the LFS essential pre-reading list.

Before building an LFS system, we recommend reading the following:

- Software-Building-HOWTO [http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO.html]()
  This is a comprehensive guide to building and installing "generic" Unix software packages under Linux. Although it was written some time ago, it still provides a good summary of the basic techniques needed to build and install software.
- Beginner's Guide to Installing from Source [http://moi.vonos.net/linux/beginners-installing-from-source/]()
  This guide provides a good summary of basic skills and techniques needed to build software from source code.
