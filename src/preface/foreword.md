# Foreword

My journey to learn and better understand Linux began back in 1998. I had just installed my first Linux distribution and hadquickly become intrigued with the whole concept and philosophy behindLinux.

There are always many ways to accomplish a single task. The same can besaid about Linux distributions. A great many have existed over the years.  Somestill exist, some have morphed into something else, yet others have beenrelegated to our memories.  They all do things differently to suit the needs oftheir target audience.  Because so many different ways to accomplish the sameend goal exist, I began to realize I no longer had to be limited by any oneimplementation. Prior to discovering Linux, we simply put up with issues inother Operating Systems as you had no choice. It was what it was, whether youliked it or not. With Linux, the concept of choice began to emerge.  If youdidn't like something, you were free, even encouraged, to change it.

I tried a number of distributions and could not decide on any one. Theywere great systems in their own right. It wasn't a matter of right andwrong anymore. It had become a matter of personal taste. With all thatchoice available, it became apparent that there would not be a singlesystem that would be perfect for me. So I set out to create my own Linuxsystem that would fully conform to my personal preferences.

To truly make it my own system, I resolved to compile everything fromsource code instead of using pre-compiled binary packages. This
"perfect" Linux system would have the strengths of varioussystems without their perceived weaknesses. At first, the idea was ratherdaunting. I remained committed to the idea that such a system could bebuilt.

After sorting through issues such as circular dependencies and compile-timeerrors, I finally built a custom-built Linux system. It was fullyoperational and perfectly usable like any of the other Linux systems outthere at the time. But it was my own creation. It was very satisfying tohave put together such a system myself. The only thing better would havebeen to create each piece of software myself. This was the next bestthing.

As I shared my goals and experiences with other members of the Linuxcommunity, it became apparent that there was a sustained interest in theseideas. It quickly became plain that such custom-built Linux systemsserve not only to meet user specific requirements, but also serve as anideal learning opportunity for programmers and system administrators toenhance their (existing) Linux skills. Out of this broadened interest, the
*Linux From Scratch Project* was born.

This Linux From Scratch book is the central core around that project. Itprovides the background and instructions necessary for you to design andbuild your own system. While this book provides a template that will resultin a correctly working system, you are free to alter the instructions tosuit yourself, which is, in part, an important part of this project. Youremain in control; we just lend a helping hand to get you started on yourown journey.

I sincerely hope you will have a great time working on your own Linux FromScratch system and enjoy the numerous benefits of having a system that istruly your own.
