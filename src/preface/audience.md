There are many reasons why you would want to read this book. One of thequestions many people raise is, "why go through all the hassle of manuallybuilding a Linux system from scratch when you can just download and installan existing one?"

One important reason for this project's existence is to help you learnhow a Linux system works from the inside out. Building an LFS system helpsdemonstrate what makes Linux tick, and how things work together and depend oneach other. One of the best things that this learning experience can provide isthe ability to customize a Linux system to suit your own unique needs.

Another key benefit of LFS is that it allows you to have more controlover the system without relying on someone else's Linux implementation. WithLFS, you are in the driver's seat and dictate every aspect of thesystem.

LFS allows you to create very compact Linux systems. When installingregular distributions, you are often forced to install a great manyprograms which are probably never used or understood. These programs wasteresources. You may argue that with today's hard drive and CPUs, suchresources are no longer a consideration. Sometimes, however, you are stillconstrained by size considerations if nothing else. Think about bootableCDs, USB sticks, and embedded systems. Those are areas where LFS can bebeneficial.

Another advantage of a custom built Linux system is security. By compilingthe entire system from source code, you are empowered to audit everythingand apply all the security patches desired. It is no longer necessary towait for somebody else to compile binary packages that fix a security hole.Unless you examine the patch and implement it yourself, you have noguarantee that the new binary package was built correctly and adequatelyfixes the problem.

The goal of Linux From Scratch is to build a complete and usablefoundation-level system. If you do not wish to build your own Linux systemfrom scratch, you may nevertheless benefit from the information in thisbook.

There are too many other good reasons to build your own LFS system tolist them all here. In the end, education is by far the most powerful ofreasons. As you continue in your LFS experience, you will discover the powerthat information and knowledge truly bring.
