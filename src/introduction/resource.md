## FAQ

If during the building of the LFS system you encounter any errors, have any questions, or think there is a typo in the book, please start by consulting the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) that is located at [http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/faq/]().

## Mailling Lists

The `linuxfromscratch.org` server hosts a number of mailing lists used for the development of the LFS project. These lists include the main development and support lists, among others. If the FAQ does not solve the problem you are having, the next step would be to search the mailing lists at [http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/search.html]().

For information on the different lists, how to subscribe, archive locations, and additional information, visit [http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mail.html]().

## IRC

Several members of the LFS community offer assistance on Internet Relay Chat (IRC). Before using this support, please make sure that your question is not already answered in the LFS FAQ or the mailing list archives. You can find the IRC network at `irc.freenode.net`. The support channel is named #LFS-support.

## Mirror Sites

The LFS project has a number of world-wide mirrors to make accessing the website and downloading the required packages more convenient. Please visit the LFS website at [http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mirrors.html]() for a list of current mirrors.
